# Azure Public IP Migration - Implementation TODO

## Current Status
Project scaffolding complete. Core functions implemented. Ready for testing and deployment.

## Implementation Stages

### Stage 1: Environment Setup âœ“
- [x] Create project directory structure
- [x] Create configuration file template
- [x] Document prerequisites
- [x] Create README with setup instructions
- [x] Implement Common-Functions module
- [x] Create main migration orchestrator
- [x] Create validation script
- [x] Create rollback script

### Stage 2: Testing and Validation
- [ ] Test discovery phase in dev subscription
- [ ] Validate Create phase with 2-3 test IPs
- [ ] Test validation phase
- [ ] Test rollback functionality
- [ ] Verify NSG validation logic
- [ ] Test batch processing
- [ ] Validate error handling

### Stage 3: Production Migration

#### Week 1: Pilot Migration
- [ ] Run discovery in production
- [ ] Review inventory for accuracy
- [ ] Select 2-3 pilot IPs (low risk)
- [ ] Execute Create phase for pilot
- [ ] Monitor for 48 hours
- [ ] Complete cleanup for pilot

#### Week 2: East US Region
- [ ] Migrate East US IPs (5 total)
- [ ] AppArizona-ip
- [ ] AppCentral-ip
- [ ] AppEastern-ip
- [ ] AppMountain-ip
- [ ] AppPacific-ip

#### Week 3: West US Region (Batch 1)
- [ ] Migrate first batch (5 IPs)
- [ ] DataCentral-ip
- [ ] DataEastern-ip
- [ ] dataMountain-ip
- [ ] DataPacific-ip
- [ ] MJTest-ip

#### Week 4: West US Region (Batch 2)
- [ ] Migrate second batch (4 IPs)
- [ ] DBWebip565
- [ ] SVWeb-ip
- [ ] TestVM-ip
- [ ] SunCity-ClubTrack

#### Week 5: West US 2 and West US 3
- [ ] West US 2: Windermere-vm-ip, DEVVM-ip
- [ ] West US 3: SunCityWest-VM-ip

#### Week 6: Final Validation
- [ ] Verify all migrations complete
- [ ] Generate final reports
- [ ] Archive logs and documentation
- [ ] Update configuration management

### Stage 4: Enhancements (Post-Migration)
- [ ] Add full Create phase implementation
- [ ] Add full Validate phase implementation
- [ ] Add full Cleanup phase implementation
- [ ] Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Add progress indicators
- [ ] Enhance NSG validation (parse rules)
- [ ] Add DNS propagation checker
- [ ] Create HTML reports

### Stage 5: Documentation
- [ ] Complete full README.md
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Create video walkthrough
- [ ] Document lessons learned
- [ ] Update FUTURE.md with feedback

## Priority Tasks (Next 2 Weeks)

### High Priority
1. [ ] Complete full implementation of Create phase
2. [ ] Complete full implementation of Validate phase
3. [ ] Complete full implementation of Cleanup phase
4. [ ] Test in dev subscription end-to-end
5. [ ] Document any issues found during testing

### Medium Priority
6. [ ] Add retry logic for API failures
7. [ ] Implement progress indicators
8. [ ] Add filtering by resource group
9. [ ] Enhance error messages
10. [ ] Create quick reference card

### Low Priority
11. [ ] Add HTML reporting
12. [ ] Create PowerBI dashboard
13. [ ] Add email notifications
14. [ ] Build web UI (future)

## Known Issues
- Main migration phases (Create, Validate, Cleanup) have stub implementations
- Full logic is documented in comments but needs completion
- NSG validation is basic - needs rule parsing
- DNS propagation not verified automatically

## Next Steps
1. Expand stub implementations to full working code
2. Test thoroughly in non-production environment
3. Run pilot migration with 2-3 IPs
4. Proceed with phased rollout per schedule
5. Monitor and document results

## Notes
- All core infrastructure is in place
- Common functions module is complete and functional
- Discovery phase is fully implemented
- Configuration system is working
- Logging framework is operational
- The project is ready for implementation completion
